The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout ans CSS flex box is that flexbox was designed for layout in 1D (1 dimension)that is either a row or a column but not both at the same time.
where as Grid was designed for 2D(2 dimension)  layouts that is row and columns at the same time.

flex box cannot easily overlap items or elements where as grid can create  overlapping layouts very easily.

The basic difference between class and id is that In Html for an element ID name starts with the “#” symbol followed by a unique name assigned to it.	
On the other hand class assigned to an element has its name starts with “.” followed by class name.
Only one ID selector can be attached to an element where as multiple class selectors can be attached to an element.
